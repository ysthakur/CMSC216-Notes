# Processes

- A process is an instance of a program in execution
- A process provides a context for the executing program:
  current memory state, open files, register contents, PC, environment variables
- Only one process can use a CPU at a time

## Multitasking

- So processes need to be occasionally suspended
- Each process thinks it has sole control of the CPU and the logical flow of one process isn't affected by others

## Kernel

- Mastor control program
- Manages memory, file, IO, and processes

## User and kernel modes

- Normally processes in user mode
- When in user mode, trying to perform privileged instruction or accessing kernel-reserved
  memory results in a fatal protection fault
- Need to use system call interface to access these instructions/areas of memory

## Implementation of multitasking

- Each process has an id (pid) because the kernel needs to maintain context and state of execution of each process
- Page table: stores processes' address spaces
- Process table: stores information (stack pointer, program counter, ...) about each process
- File table: lists which files are opened by each process

## Context switching

- When a process is to be moved out of the CPU, the context is saved and the context of the incoming process is restored
- Kernel is responsible for scheduling
- Kernel can switch out process whenever it deems it necessary or appropriate
  - When it's waiting for I/O
  - When it's been running for a long time

## System calls

- `man syscalls` to see docs
- Can call these system calls from C

## Processes vs threads

- A process can have multiple threads inside it
- Processes are independent, do not share memory
- Threads in the same process do share resources associated with that process (memory, code, files, etc.)

## Signals

- Users can trigger sending of signals
  - SIGINT: interrupt (Ctrl+C)
- Processes can also send signals to each other via kernel
- Processes have default actions when receiving signals (sometimes ignore, sometimes quit)
- Can list all signals with `kill -l` (bash gives more useful info than tcsh)

## Process life cycle

- Exact type/number of states varies by OS
- Typical states
  - Ready: process waiting to be run
  - Running: process executing on CPU
  - Waiting: waiting for an event (e.g. I/O, signal)
    - When I/O finishes or event occurs, becomes ready
  - Waiting to be reaped: finished, waiting to be terminated

## Creating new processes

- System call `fork()` creates new copy of parent process
  - Establishes parent-child relationship between the two processes
- All variables (the whole address space) are copied
- PC (point of execution) is copied
  - parent and child processes continue executing after the fork system call
- File descriptor table is copied
- Child has different pid
- Need to include `unistd.h` to use `fork()` in C
- Need `sys/types.h` to use `pid_t` (return type of `fork()`)
  - If forked successfully, `fork()` returns child PID to parent and 0 to child
    - Can use `fork() == 0` to check if current process is the child
  - If fork failed, returns -1 to parent (no child to return to)

### Process IDs

- Current process's ID can be gotten with `getpid()` (returns `pid_t`)
- Parent process's ID can be gotten with `getppid()` (returns `pid_t`)

### Things inherited by child process

- Address space
  - The address of a variable in both processes will be the same, but it's a virtual address, so each process actually has a separate copy of it
- Process credentials (user and group IDs)
- Environment
- Open file descriptors
  - The current file position is also shared between parent and child, can possibly
    cause file consistency issues
- Signal handling settings
- Current working directory
- Root directory
- Resource limits
- The controlling terminal (the program that controls stdin, stdout, and stderr)

### Things unique to child process

- Its process ID
- Own copy of file descriptors and directory streams
- Process times
- Resource utilizations usually set to 0
- Its pending signals initialized to empty set

## Process Control (`wait` and `exec`)

### Reaping child process

- Process table keeps track of child processes
- When process exits, still tracked by kernel
- Processes released from process table only when parent reaps terminated child,
  until then, it's a **zombie**
- A parent can release its zombie children using the `wait` or `waitpid` system calls
  - `pid_t wait(int *status)`
    - Blocks parent and waits for child to finish, then reaps child
    - Returns the pid of the child and a status value via its int pointer parameter,
      -1 if there is no child
    - If there are several children that have been terminated, then the parent
      arbitrarily reaps one of them and returns its pid
    - If not interested in status value, can pass `NULL`
  - Requires `<sys/types.h>` and `<sys/wait.h>`
- If parent terminates before the child, the child is orphaned and then adopted by
  the `init` process (pid 1)
  - `init` will reap children as soon as they terminate

### Status of reaped processes

- Returned status is not the same as child's exit status
- Can use macros in `<sys/wait.h>` to get information about reaped child based
  on status's value
  - `WIFEXITED(status)`: true if child terminated normally (via exit/return)
  - `WEXITSTATUS(status)`: The exit status of the normally terminated child
  - `WTERMSIG(status)`: The signal that caused the child to terminate
  - Can use `gcc -E` to see result of macros
