# Standard Input/Output

## Exit codes

- See examples in `exit_codes.c`
- From `stdlib.h`: `EXIT_SUCCESS`, `EXIT_FAILURE`
- From `sysexits.h`: `EX_OSERR`, `EX_USAGE`
- The function `exit` is not the same as returning
  - `exit` terminates the program
  - `exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);`

## Errors

### `perror`

- Prints a message to stderr describing the last error encountered during a library function or system call
- If you provide a string it will be printed before the default error description
- Relies on external variable `errno` that is set when error occurs
  - `#include <errno.h>` to get access to `errno`
  - After calling function like `fopen`, can check `errno` to see if file does not exist
  - `strerror(errno)` generates a string for the specified `errno`
    - Use `#include <string.h>`
- It is not reset for successful calls

## Standard I/O

- `stdio.h` contains prototypes and constants for I/O routines
- Most I/O is stream-based and buffered to make things more efficient
- Call `fflush` to flush buffers immediately
- Two types of files and streams: text and binary

### Text streams

- Composed of lines of text, each terminated by newline
- There are library functions to deal with text streams in 3 ways:
  - Character-oriented IO
  - Line-oriented IO
  - Formatted IO

### Binary streams

- Composed of just plain data
- We'll be focusing on
  - Line-oriented IO (`gets`, `fgets`)
  - Formatted IO (`scanf`, `sscanf`, `fscanf`, `printf`, `sprintf`, `fprintf`)

## Opening/closing files

- `FILE *` represents an open stream

## Opening files

```c
FILE *fopen(char *filename, char *mode);
```

- `mode` is whether we're going to read or write or whatever
  - `"r"` - read; file must already exist
  - `"w"` - write; if file does not exist, it's created, but if file exists, it's overwritten
  - `"a"` - append; if file does not exist, it's created
- Returns `NULL` on failure, can use `perror()` to see why it failed
- Possible to fail
  - If file does not exist, even if opening in write or append mode, if the parent directory also does not exist, will fail

### Closing files

```c
int fclose(FILE *fp);
```

- `fclose` closes a file, flushing output if necessary
- Returns 0 on success
- Failure can occur (returns `EOF` on failure)
  - The closing operation can be interrupted by the OS or other, worse, things

### Line-oriented I/O

To read:

```c
char *fgets(char *buf, int size, FILE *stream);
```

- `buf` is where you store the text
- `size - 1` is maximum number of characters to read and put into `buf` (`- 1` because need room for `\0` terminator)
- Can read less than `size - 1` characters if hit end of line (`'\n'`)
- Unlike `gets`, `fgets` includes the `\n` character
- `NULL` returned on error or EOF
- On success (no error and non-EOF), returns `buf`

To write:

```c
int fputs(const char *str, FILE *stream);
```

- Returned value is non-negative on success and EOF on failure (-1 on grace)

## Streams

- In `tcsh`, can redirect both stdin and stderr using `>&`
- Can use `CTRL-d` to indicate EOF (-1)
- Three predefined streams for every program:
  - `stdin`
  - `stdout`
  - `stderr`
- Type for streams: `FILE *`
- Can use as `FILE *my_stream = stdin;`

## `printf` family

### `fprintf`

```c
int fprintf(FILE *stream, char *fmt, ...);
```

- Formatted output to a stream
- `char *fmt, ...` is similar to `printf` syntax
- `printf(...)` is like doing `fprintf(stdout, ...)`

### `sprintf`

```c
int sprintf(char *buf, char *fmt, ...);
```

- Formats output and places in `buf`

### `snprintf`

```c
int snprintf(char *buf, size_t limit, char *fmt, ...);
```

- Like `sprintf`, but wites at most `limit - 1` characters to `buf`, then null byte

## `scanf` family

### `fscanf`

```c
int fscanf(FILE *stream, char *fmt, ...);
```

- Reads into formatted input (`fmt`) from stream
- `char *fmt, ...` is similar to `scanf` syntax
- `scanf(...)` is like doing `fscanf(stdin, ...)`

### `scanf`

- Doesn't check for type agreement between format specifier and associated variable
- If a given format specifier doesn't match, `scanf` stops processing there
- Returns the number of items that were successfully scanned and assigned to variables
  - Allows you to check whether input was correctly scanned
- Returns EOF (-1) on end of file

### `sscanf`

```c
int sscanf(char str[], char *fmt, ...);
```

- Like `fscanf` but reads from string instead of stream
- Returns EOF if nothing is read (e.g. str argument is empty or is only spaces)
